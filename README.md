# Plexi

Plexi is a task-based platform designed to connect individuals seeking side gigs with elderly people and busy professionals who need various services. Plexi allows users to offer or request help with everyday tasks, ranging from household chores to errands.

## User Personas

Plexi features three key user personas:

- **Tasker**: A person offering services or completing tasks for others. Taskers can browse available tasks, accept them, and complete them based on their skills and availability.
  
- **Requester**: A person who needs help with tasks. Requesters can post tasks, review available Taskers, and select someone to complete the task.
  
- **Admin**: The admin manages and oversees the platform. Admins have additional privileges, such as monitoring tasks, managing users, and maintaining the overall functionality of the platform.

## Features

- **User Roles**: Plexi supports three user roles: Taskers, Requesters, and Admins. Each role has specific capabilities, and users can interact with the platform based on their role.
- **Task Matching**: Taskers and Requesters can post, accept, and complete tasks within various categories, such as household chores, errands, and more.
- **User Profiles**: Users can create and manage their profiles, showcasing their skills, experience, and preferences.
- **Admin Dashboard**: Admins have a dashboard to monitor platform activity, manage users, and maintain task flow.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: Web application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- **Backend**: Basic server-side logic to support task matching and user interactions.
- **Database**: A mySQL database is used to store user data, tasks, and platform-related information.
